# Deep-learning-for-in-vivo-near-infrared-imaging

This reposotory is our project for the paper "Deep learning for in vivo near-infrared imaging".  
The code is based on the original implementation of CycleGAN and pix2pix https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix. We simplified the code for our task.
